**Jewel Store** is an API REST with filtering capabilities.

_This project was developed as the \*Advanced API REST Design** assignment in the **Backend with Node and Express** course for Desafio LATAM's **Full Stack with JavaScript\*\* bootcamp_

## Assignment Background üìñ

The jewelry store My Precious Spa needs to change its desktop application for a modern and dynamic one. To perform this task, it contacted a Full Stack Developer to develop the REST API of a client application to meet the specific needs of its users in an efficient, maintainable and effective way.

You will need to create a REST API that allows:

1. Resource limiting
2. Resource filtering by fields
3. Pagination
4. Sorting
5. HATEOAS data structure
